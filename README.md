## Event-Driven Dual-Attention Spiking Neural Network for Energy-Efficient Detection of Coffee Fruit Maturity
</div>

This repository provides the official implementation of **E2DA-SNN**, an event-driven spiking neural network for energy-efficient object detection.  

The code is released to support reproducibility of the experimental results reported in the paper.

---

### Requirements

The code has been tested with the following environment:

- Python: 3.8  
- PyTorch: 1.10.0  
- CUDA: 11.3  
- cuDNN: 8.2.0

<summary>Install</summary>

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Datasets

This project uses two public datasets for fruit maturity detection:

- **COFFEE_FOB**: Primary benchmark dataset, containing 2365 images captured under real-world orchard conditions, including dense fruit distributions, non-uniform illumination, and partial occlusions. [Download link](https://universe.roboflow.com/nata-zlj1h/coffee_fob-gekr0/dataset)

- **Cherry**: Secondary dataset, containing 2700 images with similar characteristics. [Download link](https://universe.roboflow.com/project-k2yri/cherry-tnrjs/dataset)

> A small subset of sample images and labels are included in this repository (`dataset/images_samples` and `dataset/labels_samples`) to illustrate the data format. Please download the full datasets from the links above for training and evaluation.

### Pretrained Checkpoints

We provide pretrained [E2DA](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VsOd_sk0Wf6R8SFKw9sLLP9xopR7hcHw/view?usp=sharing) and [E2DA-Lite](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kmgp-MgIiW2n2igNH68Xw-21OB3YuJxx/view?usp=sharing) models on the COFFEE_FOB dataset.
