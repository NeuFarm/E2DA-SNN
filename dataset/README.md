# Datasets

This repository provides the implementation of the proposed **E2DA-SNN** model.
Due to GitHub storage limitations, the full datasets are hosted on external platforms.
Only a small number of sample images and annotation files are provided in this repository
for illustration and reproducibility purposes.

The **COFFEE_FOB** and **Cherry** datasets are public datasets obtained from Roboflow.
They contain images captured under real-world orchard environments, including dense fruit
distributions, non-uniform illumination, and partial occlusions.
Among them, **COFFEE_FOB** serves as the primary benchmark dataset in our experiments.

## Sample Files

The `images_samples/` and `labels_samples/` directories provide a small subset of example
images and corresponding annotation files from the **COFFEE_FOB** dataset. These samples
are included to illustrate the data format and labeling style used in our experiments.

## Dataset Structure

After downloading and extracting the datasets, the directory structure should follow the
standard YOLO format:
```text
COFFEE_FOB/
|-- images/
|   |-- train/
|   |-- val/
|   |-- test/
|-- labels/
|   |-- train/
|   |-- val/
|   |-- test/
|-- data.yaml
```

The Cherry dataset follows the same directory structure.
